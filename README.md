<h2>ðŸ”»About this projectðŸ”»<br></h2>
âš¡This aim of this project is to write codes for plotting modulated and demodulated signal in time domain using envlope detectorcirciut for a normal amplitude waveform. In additon, 
to evalute the optimum value of the time constant that minimizes the mean square error between the modulated signal s(t) and the output signal of the envelope detector using 
Matlab Software.âš¡
